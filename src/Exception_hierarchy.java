// Throwable is root class for any exception in java
// Two child classes of throwable are exception and error
// Programming logic is responsible for exception, and it is recoverable(we can handle the exception using try catch)
//Programming logic is not responsible for error(it is caused due to lack of system resources like virus, memory issue), and it is not recoverable
